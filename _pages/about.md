I'm Phillip Si, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech working with Professor Peng Chen and Professor Chao Zhang on uncertainty estimation and generative models, specifically using them to conduct data assimilation problems.

I finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at Cornell University, where I worked with Professor Volodymyr Kuleshov, and a year of masters' at Carnegie Mellon University in the Machine Learning Department.

My hobbies include cooking and gaming.
