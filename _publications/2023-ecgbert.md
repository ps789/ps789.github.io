collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/2023-ecgbert
excerpt: 'In the medical field, current ECG signal analysis approaches rely on supervised deep neural networks trained for specific tasks that require substantial amounts of labeled data. However, our paper introduces ECGBERT, a self-supervised representation learning approach that unlocks the underlying language of ECGs. By unsupervised pre-training of the model, we mitigate challenges posed by the lack of well-labeled and curated medical data. ECGBERT, inspired by advances in the area of natural language processing and large language models, can be fine-tuned with minimal additional layers for various ECG-based problems. Through four tasks, including Atrial Fibrillation arrhythmia detection, heartbeat classification, sleep apnea detection, and user authentication, we demonstrate ECGBERT's potential to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks.'
